This is a cute game with chickens, it is a web based game built with electron.
You can have up to 30 chickens but the game will freeze if you try to add more than that.
It currently doesn't save game data but it's still fun, I made it as more as a personal project than a finished product.
It is currently only available on macOS 12+ with apple silicon chips.
